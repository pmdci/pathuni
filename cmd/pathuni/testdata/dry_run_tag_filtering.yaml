# Test configuration for dry-run tag filtering scenarios
# This config corresponds to the spec example:
# pathuni dry-run --tags-include=dev+work,audio --tags-exclude=gaming,video

# Expected results:
# 5 Included Paths: usr/local/go/bin, home/Pratt/.cargo/bin, Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin, home/Pratt/.npm-global/bin, usr/local/bin
# 8 Skipped Paths: opt/games/bin, System/Library/Frameworks, usr/local/node/bin, Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin, home/Pratt/.local/bin, opt/homebrew/bin, usr/games, nonexistent/path

all:
  paths:
    - "/tmp/pathuni/usr/local/bin"  # no tags â†’ always included

macos:
  paths:
    # INCLUDED PATHS (match dev+work OR audio, no gaming/video)
    - path: "/tmp/pathuni/usr/local/go/bin"

      tags: [audio, personal]  # matches audio
    
    # EXCLUDED PATHS - matches exclude filters
